ROZS TAMAS PORTFOLIO

A custom-built portfolio website for Tamas Rozs, musician and cellist.

WHAT IS INSIDE

- File-Based Management: No database required. Concerts, awards, and biographies are pulled directly from .txt files, making updates as simple as editing a text document.
- Smart Gallery: A responsive image grid with a custom-built Lightbox. You can click into photos and navigate through them using the UI or keyboard arrows.
- Dynamic Concerts: The site automatically detects the current year and month to display upcoming shows, but also allows users to look back through the full yearly archive.

TECH STACK

- PHP: Handles the logic for reading text files and managing the concert archive.
- Vanilla JavaScript: Powers the AJAX "Single Page Application" feel and the gallery Lightbox.
- CSS3: Custom styles using Grid and Flexbox.
